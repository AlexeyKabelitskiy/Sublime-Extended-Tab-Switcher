# Extended tab switcher for Sublime Text

View all open files (sorted/unsorted) for switching between them.


This plugin is inspired by the default tab switcher in netbeans which displays the open files to choose from on pressing `ctrl+alt+tab`.
user can change the default key binding at `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Extended Tab Switcher -> Key Bindings User`


By default the the files are sorted in the order of "open files" in the side bar. To enable the sorting the user can change the defauly key binding at `Preferences -> Package Settings -> Extended Tab Switcher -> Settings - User` and adding the following flag

```javascript
{
	"sort": "true"
}
```
